2nd run of route add script against all servers that had logged repo errs of some sort

23-mar - SoftLayer had fixed many servers that were initially reported out of the 56 initially reported.

Running again against all the servers found to see which ones we may still have issues with & changing wait time for yum to run - extending time a bit to hopefully avoid marking some as errors that actually completed successfully.
