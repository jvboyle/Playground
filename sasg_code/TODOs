- change user-based -> group-based (bluepage group). 
  + a person may belong to multiple groups (a person does not own customer, but a group does)
  + Need an admin group that can control all groups.


- make script running wider and max height (when too long, it does not show buttons)
- customer delegating (not sure how to manage the info)
- bluegroup (there is a shared info between users, so only authorized user needs to be logged in) -> only gsni network related. command is fine.
- vyos and tools server dump
- vyatta dest, source nat info. implementation
- put the sasg_install.sh file into EE server and provide a link to IT admin? (how can they access to the file?)
- detach network setup from network address reservation
- SASG_VIP1 should be changed to be flexible -> multiple SASG_VIP[]
- Recreate the package button (refresh)

- testing, testing, testing...

When RSA key is crypted.....??
09-28 18:48 root         ERROR    *** Caught exception: <class 'paramiko.ssh_exception.AuthenticationException'>: Authentication failed.

DONE---
- bluepage ip address
- a consolidated button
- Think about how to handle 2222 port if need to rerun the scripts? or never rerun?
