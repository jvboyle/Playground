#
# Updates in this version:
#
# V1.3 - ksunberg@us.ibm.com - functional update: fix userdel negation, enhance usermod, add pam_tally2,
# add setpw.<os> binary (AUTOHEAL), add Notes.

# + /usr/sbin/userdel, !/usr/sbin/userdel * root, \

# + !<:local_path>/setpw.linux * root, !<:local_path>/setpw.linux * root *, \
#
# + Notes:
# + Use of usermod on the root ID is limited to modification of the gecos attribute.  Usermod will be blocked if the specified gecos
# + contains " -".  If gecos must contain " -" then it must be set by a System Administrator.
# + The recommended/preferred value for <:local_path> is /opt/IBM/IAMmanual/bin.
# + All directories in <:local_path>, as well as setpw.<os>, iam_acct_provision.sh must have ownership (typically uid=0, gid=0) and
# + permissions such that the ability to update is restricted to the System Administrators and their automation agents.
