## This is the inventory that itemizes the VMs that need to be deployed.
## While this solution only has one VM, multiple VMs can be added using
## a line for each one.
# Walkthrough of the items on the line below:
# The first item (automation-control-node) is the host name of the VM that will be provisioned
# "ansible_host":  is the IP address of the provisioned VM. This is needed
#    so that Ansible knows how to access "automation-control-node".
# "custom_ip":  is the IP address to be used. See the "control-node-answerfile.yml"
# "ansible_host_group":
# "guest_notes" : a note to tell Ansible what this is.
